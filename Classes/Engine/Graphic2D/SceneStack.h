 * \brief	A singleton class that manages the roots of the GameObjects (e.g. the scenes).
 * \details
 *	The top scene is also the running one. There's no way to run a scene that is not at the top of the stack.
 *	The top scene (and only) will be update once a frame.
 *	If the last scene is popped, an exception will be thrown and the application will be terminated.
 *	To save memory, don't make the length of the stack too long.
