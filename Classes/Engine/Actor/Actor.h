/*!
 * \brief	Almost everything in the game is a Actor, such as an unit, a strategy map, an effect of an explosion, and so on.
 * \
 * \details
 *	Actors are organized in the form of trees. Methods like addChild, removeFromParent are provided for organizing.
 *	Roots of the trees are Actors that created as "scene". They should be push into SceneStack to take their effects.
 *	Game object is a container of various components and/or scripts which implement most of the logics of the real game object.
 *	Game objects, along with its components, are managed with std::unique_ptr.
 *	For most cases in the code base, a std::unique_ptr means an ownership, while a raw pointer stands for a (temporary) reference.
 *	Now refactoring...
